<p>Hi there,<br/><br/>
You have been invited to authenticate the <strong>CiviContact mobile application</strong> with your CiviCRM site. Please follow these steps:<br/>
1. Make sure you have the CiviContact app installed on your mobile device. This app is available in the iTunes or Google Play Store.<br/>
2. Open this email on your <strong>mobile device</strong> where the CiviContact has been <strong>installed</strong>.<br/>
3. Click on this <a href="{$auth_url}">CiviContact authentication link</a> which should launch CiviContact and complete the authentication.<br/>
Note: This CiviContact authentication link will <strong>expire after 24 hours</strong> and a new link will be required.<br/>
